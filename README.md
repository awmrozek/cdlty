# My code golf - Code@LTH

Did you ever wanted to improve your coding speed?
My solution is to code a thousand easy problems.
Here are some solutions to some of the problems I enjoyed solving with Code@LTH - a computer club in Lund.

5 problems / day? Check!
140 words per minute? Check!

This repository contains my solutions to problems
from Kattis.com and some other websites with programming problems.

These solutions are not most optimal.
Neither can I guarantee that all of them pass 100% of test cases.
