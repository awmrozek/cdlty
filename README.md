# My code golf - Code@LTH

This repository contains my solutions to problems
from site codility and Kattis. Both of them are websites
for providing online programming contests.

These solutions don't have to be most optimal but I enjoy
solving these assignments whenever I can.

These solutions were written while I was with Code@LTH computer club
