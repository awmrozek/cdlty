# My code golf - Code@LTH

Did you ever wanted to improve your coding speed?
My solution is to code a thousand easy problems.
Here are some solutions to some of the problems I enjoyed solving with Code@LTH - a computer club in Lund.

5 problems / day? Check!
140 words per minute? Check!

This repository contains my solutions to problems
from site codility and Kattis. Both of them are websites
for providing online programming contests.

These solutions don't have to be most optimal but I enjoy
solving these assignments whenever I can.
